1. Our project is to create visualization using goal-tending data from NHL to understand goalie performance. We are working with the NHL goal-tending data which contains 22 columns and more than 49 thousand rows. This NHL dataset is fetched by the NHL official website API endpoints. And among those attributes, we are maninly interested in the spatial data (x,y), which is the coordinates of the shots/goals, and the goalie information, such as firstname and last name. And the static visualization is essentially the Ice Rink map representation of the data with the interaction of allowing users to choose two different goalies to compare the goalie performance.



2. demonstrate the interactive visulization, the visual encoding, use of space, how one might interact with the visualization


I mentioned the use of if and else statements to decide the colour of shots missed and blocked for the encoding part
And how we scaled the x and y axis to present all the data at once on a default window
The fact that we scaled to -43,43
For theory guideline I talked about how we followed theupâ€™s guideline by minimizing the amount of colour and unnecessary text in our visualization
We made sure to only use colour when necessary

Tufte's Guidelines as Heuristics for Evaluating a Visualization

Minimize ink while maximizing data ink 

Maximize data density 

Avoid chartjunk 

Create multifunctioning graphics

Make use of parallelism (small multiples) 

Consider 3D carefully 

Consider colour carefully 

Narrative of space and time

This visualization is based on the time-series data and display the data over time in a good manner.
